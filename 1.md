   10. at any time, if the contact information for your account is no longer valid;

       no earlier than **25** days after the cancellation date, if your account was cancelled for non-payment; or

       no earlier than **35** days after the cancellation date, if your account was cancelled for any other reason, and you have an unpaid final balance of **$20** or more or you have not returned rental Equipment.

   11. 

   12. **Will I be subject to any administrative charges?**

   13. We may apply administrative charges in connection with your account, including as a result of the following:

   14. price plan change;

       phone number (or other identifier) change;

       transfer of Service;

       bill reprint requests;

       **Not applicable to residents of Québec\*:**

       collection efforts due to non-payment;

       returned or rejected payments; and/or

       the restoral or suspension of Service.

       A list of these charges is available on request, or at [rogers.com/charges](http://www.rogersteamspace.com/sites/legaldms/Matter Documents/sara.sytsma/Terms of Service Rewrite 2014-LEGAL2014-273/Rogers TOS Drafts/rogers.com/charges), and forms part of these Terms.

   15. **What if I do not understand or disagree with a charge on my bill?**

   16. Any questions or discrepancies regarding charges must be reported to us within **90** days of the date of the applicable bill. Failure to notify us within this time period means that you have accepted those charges. If any of those discrepancies resulted in unauthorized or incorrect charges on your account, then we will reverse those charges within **30** days of receiving notice from you.

   17. If you have reported a billing discrepancy to us, then we will wait at least **10** days before cancelling your service in accordance with Section 2(h) or Section 2(i).

   18. **How do discounts and promotions work?**

   19. We will apply a discount, promotion or benefit to your account as long as you remain eligible for it. We may check your eligibility from time to time, and if you become ineligible to receive that discount, promotion or benefit for any reason, we may remove it and/or transfer your Service to a comparable Service plan, without prior notice.

   20. **How is mobile local and long distance airtime charged?**

   21. Local and long distance airtime charges are rounded up to the next full minute. A one-minute minimum charge applies to every completed call (made or received). The airtime for the entire call is charged based on the applicable rate at the beginning of the call. Airtime charges (plus long distance, if applicable) apply to completed or answered calls from the moment you press SEND until you press END and includes the ring time. For international calls or while roaming, you may be charged regardless of whether the call is completed.

   22. **How does Rogers determine if I’m on a long distance mobile call?**

   23. Mobile local calling areas are the areas in which you can make or receive calls without incurring long distance charges. Mobile calls are defined as local or long distance based on local calling areas. Your location at the time of the call, your mobile phone number and the phone number called are all important factors in determining local calling areas and mobile long distance. Your “Incoming Local Calling Area” is based on the geographical location associated with your mobile number. All calls that you receive while you are in your Incoming Local Calling Area are local. All calls that you receive while you are outside your Incoming Local Calling Area are long distance. Your “Outgoing Local Calling Area” is determined by your physical location. If you dial a number that is local to your physical location, then it is a local call. If you dial a number that is long distance to your physical location, then it is a long distance call. When using Call Forwarding, long distance charges apply when the number to which you forward the call is outside the geographical location associated with your mobile number, regardless of your physical location. Visit rogers.com/longdistance for current long distance rates.

   24. **How is home phone long distance calling charged and how does Rogers determine if I’m on a long distance home phone call?**

   25. Long distance charges are rounded up to the next full minute. A one-minute minimum charge applies to every completed long distance call you make. For international calls, you may be charged regardless of whether the call is completed. For home phone Services, calls are defined as local or long distance based on local calling areas, and your local calling area depends on your home phone number. If you dial a number that is long distance to your home phone number, then it is a long distance call. When using Call Forwarding, long distance charges apply when the number to which you forward the call is outside your local calling area.

4. **Deposit and Credit Requirements**

   1. **Does Rogers require security deposits or other payment or credit requirements?**
   2. Yes, we may require a security deposit or impose other payment or credit requirements such as interim payments, mandatory prepayments, or pre-authorized payments.
   3. **How are security deposits used?**
   4. Any security deposit you provide to us will be kept for at least **12** months, unless your Services are cancelled sooner. After **12** months, we may release and apply the security deposit against your account balance if we determine that your payment history has been satisfactory or that you have otherwise met our financial criteria for the return of the security deposit. We may apply your security deposit toward your account if you do not pay your bill and we may require you to replenish the security deposit after use. We will notify you when we apply all or part of any security deposit. We will return to you any security deposit with applicable interest within **30** days of cancellation of your Services or once we have determined that the conditions for returning the security deposit have been met.
   5. **Will I earn any interest on security deposits?**
   6. Yes, you will earn interest on your security deposit with us, using the Bank of Canada’s overnight rate in effect at the time, plus **1** percent, on the basis of the actual number of days in a year, accruing on a monthly basis. Interest is earned starting from the date we collect a security deposit from you (but no earlier than required under applicable legislation or regulation) until the date we return it to you.
   7. **Will Rogers impose a credit limit on my account?**
   8. Upon notice to you, we may assign or change a credit limit on your account at any time. Service may be suspended at any time to any and all of your accounts if your balance, including unbilled usage and pending charges, fees and adjustments, exceeds this limit. Recurring service charges continue to apply during any suspension of Services.

5. **Your Use of the Services**

   1. 

   2. **Do I own my phone number?**

   3. You do not own any phone number, e-mail address or other identifier assigned to you. Rogers cannot guarantee that these identifiers will never be changed, but we will only change them when necessary in extreme circumstances and will make a reasonable attempt to notify you in advance of the change. Rogers may provide Services through other identifiers when necessary.

   4. **Does Rogers monitor the content that I transmit when I use the Services?**

   5. We have the right, but not the obligation, to monitor or investigate any content that is transmitted using the Services (other than voice Services) or the Equipment. We may also access or preserve content or information to comply with legal process in Canada or foreign jurisdictions, operate the Services, ensure compliance with an Agreement, or protect ourselves, our customers or the public.

   14. Yahoo!, through its corporate entities may provide Rogers internet Service customers with access to a collection of resources, including various communications tools and content (the “Yahoo! Services”). When you use the Yahoo! Services, Yahoo!’s terms of service, guidelines and rules (“Yahoo!

Please note that for the first 90 days following the Activation Date, if you are roaming off the Rogers network, your Service will be restricted from placing outgoing calls to destinations other than those that have a North American area code (including Canada and the USA) and the destination at which you are located while placing the call (not applicable to prepaid service).

   8. **For residential Services:**

If any of your Services or accounts have been cancelled, then you authorize us and our representatives to enter or have access to your premises to disconnect the Services and remove our Equipment, as applicable.

   11. **Who is responsible for ensuring that my Equipment is compatible and up to date?**

   12. Equipment and related software may have to meet certain minimum requirements and be maintained in certain ways and in certain locations in order to access the Services or for the proper operation of the Services (e.g., 9-1-1 services). Those requirements may change from time to time without notice and you are responsible for updating or maintaining your Equipment and software as necessary to meet those requirements. We may provide software updates for the Equipment for the continued operation of the Services or the Equipment. Likewise, from time to time we may have to modify or remove previous software features in order to introduce new features to ensure that the Equipment remains compatible with technological advancements.

   12. **For mobile Services:**

   8. If any portion of an Agreement is unenforceable, the remaining provisions continue in full force. Our failure to enforce strict performance of any provision of an Agreement does not mean we have waived any provision or right. Neither the course of conduct between us nor trade practice modifies any provision of an Agreement.

**Unlawful or Inappropriate Content**

Any Rogers Party reserves the right to move, remove or refuse to post any content, in whole or in part, that it, in its sole discretion, decide are unacceptable, undesirable or in violation of the Terms or this AUP. This includes, without limitation:

For purposes of this AUP, "**content**" refers to all forms of communications including, without limitation, text, graphics (including photographs, illustrations, images, drawings, logos), executable programs, audiovisual recordings, and audio recordings.

**Security**

As set out above, you are responsible for any misuse of the Services, by you or by any other person with access to the Services through your Equipment or your account. Therefore, you must take steps to ensure that others do not gain unauthorized access to the Services through any means, including, without limitation, wireless networking and wired networking. The Services may not be used to breach the security of another user or to attempt to gain access to any other person’s equipment, software or data, without the knowledge and consent of such person. Additionally, the Services may not be used in any attempt to circumvent the user authentication or security of any host, network, or account, including, without limitation, accessing data not intended for you, logging into or making use of a server or account you are not expressly authorized to access, or probing the security of other networks. Use or distribution of tools designed for compromising security, such as password guessing programs, cracking tools, packet sniffers or network probing tools, is prohibited. You may not disrupt the Services. The Services also may not be used to interfere with computer networking or telecommunications services to any user, host or network, including, without limitation, denial of service attacks, flooding of a network, overloading a service, improper seizing and abuse of operator privileges and attempts to "**crash**" a host. The transmission or dissemination of any information or software that contains a virus or other harmful feature is also prohibited. You are solely responsible for the security of any device you choose to connect to the Services, including any data stored on that device. In particular, Rogers recommends against enabling file or printer sharing of any sort. Rogers recommends that any files or services you do choose to make available for remote access be protected with a strong password or as otherwise appropriate. You agree to treat as confidential all access codes, personal identification numbers and/or other passwords that we may provide to you for use with the Services.

**Unsolicited Communications**

As set out above, the Services may not be used to send unsolicited, bulk or commercial messages or for any other unsolicited communications. This includes, without limitation, using automatic dialing and announcing devices to or otherwise make unsolicited voice or facsimile calls and bulk mailing of commercial advertising, informational announcements, charity requests, petitions for signatures and political or religious messages. Such communications may only be directed to those who have explicitly requested it.

The Services may not be used to send messages to any individual who has indicated that he/she does not wish to receive messages from you. The Services may not be used to collect responses from unsolicited e-mail messages sent from accounts on other Internet hosts or e-mail services that violate this AUP or the acceptable use policy of any other Internet service provider. Moreover, unsolicited e-mail messages may not direct the recipient to any web site or other resource that uses the Services.

Forging, altering or removing e-mail headers is prohibited. You may not reference any Rogers network (for example, by including “Organization: Rogers” in the header or by listing an IP address that belongs to a Rogers network) in any unsolicited e-mail even if that e-mail is not sent through a Rogers network. “**Mail bombing**” is prohibited. That is, you may not send numerous copies of the same or substantially similar messages, nor may you send very large messages or files to a recipient with the intent to disrupt a server or account. The propagation of chain letters is similarly prohibited, whether or not the recipient wishes to receive such mailings. Rogers is not responsible for the forwarding of e-mail sent to any account that has been suspended or terminated. Such e-mail will be returned to sender, ignored, deleted, or stored temporarily, at Rogers’ sole discretion.

**User-Generated Content Services**

"**User-Generated Content Services**" or "**UGC Services**" refers to any services that allow an end user to post, upload or generate content online to be shared with a limited or unlimited number of recipients and may include, without limitation: newsgroups, online forums, message boards, chat programs, wiki’s, photo sharing services, customer review sites, video sharing services, blogs and web hosting. Any User-Generated Content Services accessed through the Services must be used in accordance with the following:

7. you must not use the UGC Service to perform "**flooding**", which refers to deliberately repeating actions in quick succession in order to fill the screens of other Internet users with text or other content;
8. any computer or other device connected through the Services may not maintain more than two simultaneous chat connections including, without limitation, the use of automated programs, such as "**bots**" or "**clones**". Automated programs may not be used when the account holder is not physically present at the device;
9. you must not use the Services to send messages that disrupt another user's equipment, software, hardware or user display; and
10. you must not forge, alter or obscure your identity (other than using a nickname) while participating in the UGC Service.

**Usage, Data Storage and Other Limitations**

You must comply with the then current usage, data storage and other limitations on your applicable Services. You must also ensure that your activity does not improperly restrict, inhibit, or degrade any other subscriber’s use of the Services, nor represent (in the sole judgment of Rogers) an unusually large burden on our networks or third party networks for which we have roaming or network sharing agreements. In addition, you must ensure that your activity does not improperly restrict, inhibit, disrupt, degrade or impede Rogers’ ability to deliver the Services, and monitor and investigate the Services, backbone, network nodes, and/or other network services or components. You may not resell, share, or otherwise distribute the Services or any portion thereof to any third party without the written consent of Rogers. For example, you cannot provide Internet access to others through a dial up connection, host shell accounts over the Internet, provide e-mail or news service, or send a news feed. The Services are consumer products designed for personal purposes. For example, the Services do not provide the type of security, upstream performance and total downstream throughput capability typically associated with commercial use. You may not run a server in connection with the Services. You may not provide network services to others via the Services. In addition, you are prohibited from running servers for mail, http, ftp, irc, and dhcp, and multi-user interactive forums.

Your use of the Services may be subject to a usage limit, as set out in your Agreement. If you exceed that limit, you may be subject to additional usage charges.

**Network Management**

We reserve the right to manage our networks (or third party networks for which we have roaming or network sharing agreements) in order to optimize their efficiency for the benefit of our subscribers, including, without limitation, by way of the following: rate limiting (speed), rejection or removal of spam or otherwise unsolicited bulk e-mail, anti-virus mechanisms, and protocol filtering. We may take any other action we deem appropriate in order to help ensure the integrity of the network experience for all subscribers. For details on our network management practices, visit [http://www.rogers.com/networkpolicy. ](http://www.rogers.com/networkpolicy)

**Violation of this Acceptable Use Policy**

As set out in the Terms, we have the right, but not the obligation, to monitor or investigate any content that is transmitted using the Services (other than voice Services) or the Equipment; and to access or preserve content or information in accordance with the Terms. We prefer to advise subscribers of inappropriate behavior and any necessary corrective action. However, if the Services are used in a way that we, in our sole discretion, believe violates this AUP, any of the Rogers Parties may take any responsive actions they deem appropriate. Such actions may include, without limitation, temporary or permanent removal of content, cancellation of newsgroup posts, filtering of Internet transmissions, and/or the immediate suspension or termination of all or any portion of the Services or your account. The Rogers Parties will have no liability for any such responsive actions. The above described actions are not exclusive remedies and the Rogers Parties may take any other legal or technical action deemed appropriate. Upon termination of an account, any of the Rogers Parties are authorized to delete any files, programs, data and e-mail messages associated with such account. The failure to enforce this AUP, for whatever reason, shall not be construed as a waiver of any right to do so at any time. If any portion of this AUP is held invalid or unenforceable, that portion will be construed consistent with applicable law as nearly as possible, and the remaining portions will remain in full force and effect. This AUP shall be exclusively governed by, and construed in accordance with the governing law provision set out in the Terms.

**Complaints**
Please direct any complaints of violations of this AUP to [abuse@rogers.com ](mailto:abuse@rogers.com) or contact us at 1-888-ROGERS1. Questions or complaints, concerning third party content should be addressed to the applicable content provider.

### Rogers Privacy Policy

**Introduction**

Rogers works hard to earn and maintain our customers’ trust. Protecting the personal information that we handle is important to our company, our leadership, and all employees within our organization. We actively take steps to ensure that your personal information is safe and secure, including implementing policies and procedures to comply with applicable Canadian privacy laws and regulations. Our Privacy Policy (“Notice”) is intended to provide transparency about how we manage your personal information.

**Scope and Application**

This Notice applies to all personal information collected by or on behalf of Rogers Communications Inc. and its affiliates (collectively, the “Rogers Group”).

It also provides an overall description of how we handle personal information when conducting our business with you, including but not limited to, providing the following:

- wireless services;
- residential services (including TV, satellite, Internet, in-home Wi-Fi, home phone, and home security);
- financial services, including those offered by Rogers Bank;
- sports and entertainment services offered by Rogers Sports and Media (including television and radio broadcasting, specialty channels, multi-platform shopping, and digital media);
- any applicable enterprise services; and
- websites and Wi-Fi in public, retail, and corporate locations.

Information collected through your interactions with the Toronto Blue Jays [https://www.mlb.com/bluejays/team/rogers-blue-jays-baseball-partnership-privacy-policy] or the Rogers Centre [https://www.mlb.com/bluejays/ballpark/privacy-policy] are not subject to this Notice.

Throughout this Notice, we refer to the Rogers Group as “Rogers”, “we”, “us” or “our”.

We may update this Notice or other privacy-related documents from time-to-time. The current Notice will be available on our website at [rogers.com/privacy ](https://www.rogers.com/privacy).

**Consent**

When you sign up for or use a Rogers product or service, you provide your consent to the collection, use, and disclosure of your personal information as outlined in this Notice.

The form of consent sought may vary depending on the situation, level of sensitivity of the information, and your reasonable expectation. We ensure transparency so you understand the reason for the collection, use, or disclosure of your personal information. Implied consent will be used when personal information is less sensitive. For example, when you provide us your address, it is implied that it will be used to provide you with the service you requested and/or for billing purposes.

The more sensitive the information, the more likely it is that we will ask for your express consent through written, oral, electronic, or other methods.

We may also collect, use, or disclose personal information without your knowledge or consent where it is required or permitted by law.

For information on withdrawing your consent, see “Withdrawing consent” below.

**Information we collect**

Personal information is any information that identifies you or can be reasonably used to identify you. The type of personal information we collect varies based on the service you have or how you interact with us, but will include the following:

It may include a PIN, password, security questions, or biometric authentication. We have information about how much you pay us for our services, and details about each time you contact us. We have information from any survey you have responded to. We also have information about the Rogers products and services you receive from us.

**Rogers Bank information –** this includes credit card application information, such as your identification documents presented by you, including your social insurance number if you chose to provide it, your annual income, place of employment, and your other financial obligations.

**Technical information –** to enable your communications services, we collect information about how you use our networks, services, products, and websites. For example:

- Network use information. This includes information related to the operation and use of equipment, services, and applications on our wireless and fixed Internet networks. We will collect location of your wireless device on cell site data, and the IP address (the unique numbering label, which identifies your device and enables it to communicate over the Internet) that we assign to you for the provision of Internet services. It also includes records of the number of texts sent and received, voice minutes used, as well as the amount of data consumed.
- Device information. This includes device-related information including your IMEI (a mobile device identification number), your MAC address (media access control address), your mobile phone number, make and model of your device, and device operating system data.
- GPS information. Some smartphones and IoT devices also have a global positioning system (GPS) function. This is separate from our network and is not controlled by Rogers. GPS is used for a variety of location-based services and for 9-1-1 purposes. If you do not want to share your location via GPS, this setting can be turned off, although it may affect the provision of services that depend on knowing your location. Refer to the settings of your mobile device to turn this function off.
- Wi-Fi use information. This includes the destination of traffic such as websites visited and mobile applications opened, MAC address, IP address, and the length of time connected (date/time) when using Wi-Fi provided by Rogers in a public, retail, or corporate location.
- Internet use. This includes information used when providing Internet service, such as your IP address, URLs of sites visited, metadata, and data transmission information.
- TV viewing information, also known as “tuning data”. This includes information used to deliver TV services to you, such as automatically generated data related to which programs, channels and advertisements that are viewed and for how long. It also includes information about the use of set-top boxes, remote controls, and programme guides, as well as MAC address, device ID, and postal code.

**Biometrics information –** This includes behavioural biometrics such as typing patterns, mouse movements and swiping gestures when interacting with our digital platforms; voice biometrics if you have opted in to our Voice ID program for identity verification and fraud prevention when interacting with our call centres; and any other biometrics information we may collect with your consent.

Information related to the use of mobile applications (apps) offered by Rogers is covered by the Rogers Mobile Application Privacy Policy.

Information related to the use cookies and other similar technology on websites or apps offered by Rogers is covered by the Rogers Digital Privacy Policy.

**How & Why We Collect Personal Information**
*How we collect personal information*
We primarily collect information about you, from you, but we may also collect it from publicly available information and third-party sources, including credit bureaus.

**Directly from you:** We will collect personal information that you provide to us directly when you interact with us. For example, personal information is provided by you when you sign up for new products or services, use a product or service, make changes to your account, get in touch with us by phone, email or chat, visit one of our stores, interact with one of our digital properties, fill out a survey or enter a contest, participate in our online forums, or use our networks.

**From technology used at our retail stores or other company premises:** We will collect information through your interactions with various technologies. For example, when you visit a Rogers store or site such as a corporate location, we collect your information in a number of ways, including point of sale tools, via your use of Wi-Fi, or images of you through video recordings in and around our locations in order to maintain the safety of our clients, employees and others, protect against illegal activity, such as theft, vandalism and fraud, and to enhance and maintain client service quality.

**From our websites and mobile applications:** We will collect certain types of information electronically when you interact with our websites, email, mobile applications, social media accounts, online advertising, or using ours or a third party’s technologies, such as cookies, web beacons, single pixel gifs or data management platforms. More information can be found in our Mobile Applications and Digital Privacy Policies.

**Credit bureau checks:** When you apply for a product or service that involves Rogers extending credit to you, we will conduct a credit check. You give consent to this check when you submit your application. We may then exchange information about you with credit bureaus on an ongoing basis for as long as you hold the product or service and for a reasonable time afterwards. We may collect, use and share this information to verify your creditworthiness, assess and manage our credit risks, qualify you for other Rogers Group products and services, and detect and prevent fraud.

For example, Rogers Bank may obtain your credit score and other information to see if you are pre-approved for a Rogers Bank credit card. You can opt out of this practice at any time by contacting us using the information under “Addressing Your Privacy Questions, Requests and Concerns” below.

We may also validate your information with a credit bureau to verify your identity and protect against fraud. We may also periodically update your information with credit bureaus to help maintain the integrity of the credit reporting system. They then use the information to maintain the database and as permitted or required by applicable laws, which may include sharing this information with third parties.

The following are the two different types of credit bureau checks Rogers may perform:

*Hard credit checks*. This includes information about your creditworthiness, including your credit score and information about your payment history with us and at other creditors. This type of check is shown on your credit bureau report and in some instances may impact your credit.

*Soft credit checks*. If we perform a soft credit check to assess your eligibility for another Rogers service or to manage your debt with us, it will result in the collection of your credit rating, score, and profile information. This type of check does not impact your credit.

We exchange information about you, as described in this Notice, with the following credit bureaus:

TransUnion: https://www.transunion.ca/
3115 Harvester Road
Burlington, ON
L7N 3N8

Equifax: https://www.consumer.equifax.ca/
National Consumer Relations
Box 190
Montreal, Quebec
H1S 2Z2

You may access and correct information in your credit file by contacting the credit bureaus directly using the information above.

**From other sources:** We may collect information about you from other sources, such as publicly available information. We will either seek your consent or obtain the information as permitted or required by law.

***Why we collect personal information\***

***Communicate with and market to you\***
We use your personal information to communicate with you for the purposes of providing our services, including the following:

Unless we have your express consent, personal information we have about you will only be shared with organizations outside Rogers in the following circumstances:

- to a company supplying telephone or telephone directory related services; and
- where required or permitted by applicable law.

We will not sell your personal information to any organization or person, unless we sell or transfer any part of our business.

***Storage, Security Safeguards & Retention\***
Your personal information may be stored or processed in or outside Canada. No matter where this happens, the information will be protected with appropriate security safeguards and standards that adhere to applicable Canadian privacy laws. Information that is stored or processed outside Canada, may also be subject to the laws of the jurisdiction where it is held.

***Security Safeguards\***
Rogers has put in place appropriate security and safeguard procedures designed to ensure your personal information remains safe from theft, loss, or unauthorized access. We regularly review and audit our security measures and procedures to ensure that they remain effective and are consistent with industry best practices.

Rogers’ Chief Privacy Officer and delegates ensure that Rogers takes responsibility for the personal information in its possession and control. This commitment includes ensuring (through robust contractual arrangements) comparable security and safeguard procedures are applied to any third party handling such information.

We do our best to protect and safeguard your personal information, but there are safeguards you must take as well. For example, do not share your personal information such a bank card numbers, credit card numbers, associated PIN numbers, or social insurance numbers unless you clearly understand the purpose of the request and you know with whom you are dealing. Do not keep sensitive personal information in your email box. For passwords, make sure to use a combination of letters (upper and lowercases), numbers, and symbols, and do not use any words that can easily be associated with you. We also suggest that you change your password regularly.

In some instances, your specific agreement with us sets out your obligations to keep your account safe. For example, the Rogers Terms of Service requires you to ensure that others do not gain unauthorized access to your wireless or residential account, including by protecting the security of any usernames or passwords. Similarly, your Rogers Bank Cardholder Agreement contains specific requirements regarding the obligation to keep your credit card account secure.

If you are suspicious of any telephone, mail or email promotional campaigns received from us, or you suspect fraudulent activity related to one of your accounts, please contact our call centre. If you believe one of our customers is in violation of our Acceptable Use Policy, including participating in fraudulent activities like phishing, vishing, or smishing, complaints can be sent to [abuse@rogers.com ](mailto:abuse@rogers.com).

**Retention** Rogers will only retain your personal information for as long as it is necessary to fulfill the purpose for which it was collected or for sufficient time to allow you access to the information if it was used by us to make a decision about you or your account.

The length of time we retain your information will vary depending upon the information and why it was collected. In some instances, we have legal and regulatory obligations to retain your information and it cannot be deleted within those timeframes. Information that is no longer required to be retained by us will be destroyed or de-identified.

**Your privacy rights and choices**

**Access requests:** Much of the information we hold is available to you through your online account portal and through your electronic statements, like invoices. In certain circumstances, we may not be able to provide access to all the personal information we hold, for example, when the disclosure would reveal confidential business information, if the personal information is protected by legal privilege, or if the personal information was collected during an inquiry into a breach of contract or violation of a federal or provincial law.

We can not provide you access to the following types of information because we do not collect it:

- content of telephone conversations across our networks (other than recordings of calls made to our customer care centre, which are recorded for quality and training purposes);
- content of your text, picture and video messages;
- content of emails sent and received via your Rogers Yahoo!Mail account;
- content of the applications you use; and
- internet search history.

A court order is required to obtain incoming call detail information related to your account.

If you wish to access your personal information, you must make a request in writing. To respond, we require sufficient details to understand your specific request, including a full description of the information you wish to access and the period relevant to the request.

Before providing you with any information we will verify your identity and confirm that we understand your request. If there is a fee to provide any of the information requested, we will notify you in advance. Once we have confirmed the details of your requests and validated your identity, we will respond within the prescribed timeframes set out in applicable Canadian privacy law.

You can make your access request in writing using the information provided under “Addressing Your Privacy Questions, Requests and Concerns” below.

**Correction requests:** We make reasonable efforts to keep your information accurate and up-to-date. You can help by keeping us informed of any changes, like if you’re moving. If you find any errors in our information about you, let us know right away and we will make appropriate corrections. If we don't agree with your requested change, we will note your request in your file.

You can make your correction requests in writing using the information provided under “Addressing Your Privacy Questions, Requests and Concerns” below.

**Withdrawing consent:** You have the right to withdraw your consent, subject to legal or contractual restrictions and with reasonable notice.

If you decide to withdraw your consent it can, however, limit our ability to provide you with certain products, services, or offers. If you choose to withdraw consent, at that time, we will explain the impact it will have so you can make an informed decision about the impacts of doing so.

In addition, to no longer receive marketing messages via email or SMS, you may unsubscribe via the opt-out method contained in the message. If you do not want to receive telemarketing calls, please contact Rogers Customer Care to be registered on our internal Do Not Call List. You may also be informed of other options for withdrawing your consent.
